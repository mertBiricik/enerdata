A button should be provided on the page to allow users to download the entire dataset as-is.

Additionally, there should be an option to filter and download the data by years and specific data types/sectors.
For example, it should be possible to download:
- Only "Net Üretim" (Net Production) for the years 1923-1953.
- Both "Net Üretim" (Net Production) and "İthalat (+)" (Imports) for a selected year range.
- Data for specific industrial sectors such as "Gıda" (Food), "Tekstil" (Textile), or "Çimento" (Cement) under "Sanayi Tüketimi" (Industry Consumption), filtered by year.

For the data section of the website, https://ourworldindata.org should be used as a reference, particularly pages such as https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-energy-substitution.
By default, "Net Üretim" (Net Production) for all available years (e.g., 1923-2023 based on available data) can be displayed using a clean and well-chosen color palette for the line plot.
The plots should also allow filtering by:
- Years (e.g., covering the 1923-2023 range).
- Data types available in the dataset (e.g., "Net Üretim", "İthalat (+)", "İhracat (-)", "Elektrik Arzı").
- Sectors, particularly those listed under "Sanayi Tüketimi" (e.g., "Gıda", "Tekstil", "Kimya-Petrokimya") and other consumption categories like "Ulaştırma" (Transportation) or "Konut, Ticarethane ve Hizmetler" (Residential, Commercial, and Services).
